		<li><b>To inform you about Carbon Tree</b></li>
		<li><b>To communicate with you about your relationship with us</b></li>

	<h3>Protection of Information</h3>
	<p>Carbon Tree is strongly committed to protecting any personal information collected through a Website against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Carbon Tree will not sell or otherwise disclose any personal information collected from a Website, other than as described herein.</p>

These security procedures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of a Website as part of a continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as well as the electronic transmission of information.</p>
	<p>For security purposes, Carbon Tree employs software to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise damage a Website. Any information that an individual provides to Carbon Tree by visiting a Website will be stored within the United States. If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that Carbon Tree may store your information in the United States.
